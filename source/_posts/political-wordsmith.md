The values of **US left and right politics** are deeply tied to different interpretations of **liberalism** and often involve debates about how individual freedoms, equality, and government intervention should be balanced. Both sides have roots in classical liberal ideas, but they have diverged over time in how they interpret these principles.

### **US Left (Liberalism and Progressivism)**

The **US left**, often associated with **liberalism** and **progressivism**, focuses on expanding social freedoms, promoting social justice, and advocating for government intervention to address inequalities. Here's how the values of the US left are tied to the principles of liberalism:

1. **Social Liberalism and Equality**:
   - The US left supports **social liberalism**, which advocates for **government intervention** to create greater equality in society, particularly in areas like healthcare, education, and income redistribution.
   - For example, they support progressive policies such as the expansion of social welfare programs (e.g., **Medicare for All**) and raising the minimum wage to address economic disparities. These policies aim to ensure that everyone has access to basic needs and opportunities.

2. **Civil Rights and Personal Freedoms**:
   - The left emphasizes **civil rights** and **personal freedoms**, especially for marginalized groups, such as the LGBTQ+ community, racial minorities, and immigrants. This is tied to liberalism’s focus on protecting individual rights and ensuring equal treatment under the law.
   - Examples include the fight for marriage equality, criminal justice reform, and gender equality policies.

3. **Democratic Values and Representation**:
   - The left tends to prioritize **democratic participation**, pushing for policies that make voting more accessible and fair (e.g., opposing voter ID laws or supporting automatic voter registration). They argue that this strengthens democratic representation, which is central to liberalism.

4. **Environmental Justice**:
   - In line with progressive values, the US left advocates for strong **environmental protection** and climate change policies (e.g., the **Green New Deal**), arguing that government intervention is necessary to protect both the planet and vulnerable communities.

5. **Economic Liberalism vs. Social Democracy**:
   - While classical liberalism supports free markets, the US left diverges by endorsing more **regulated markets** and **social democratic** principles, where the government plays a role in managing the economy to reduce inequality and provide public services.

In summary, the US left's values are an extension of social liberalism, focusing on **equality, social justice, and government’s role** in improving the well-being of citizens while expanding personal freedoms.

### **US Right (Conservatism and Neoliberalism)**

The **US right**, often associated with **conservatism** and **neoliberalism**, focuses on protecting individual freedoms, promoting free markets, and limiting government intervention in both economic and personal affairs. Here’s how the values of the US right are tied to classical liberalism:

1. **Classical Liberalism and Economic Freedom**:
   - The US right strongly emphasizes **economic freedom** and limited government, rooted in **classical liberalism**. They believe that free markets, deregulation, and lower taxes create the best environment for personal success and prosperity.
   - Policies such as **tax cuts** for businesses and individuals, reduced government spending on welfare programs, and **deregulation** of industries are examples of this philosophy. The right believes that economic freedom leads to innovation and individual empowerment.

2. **Individual Liberty and Personal Responsibility**:
   - A key value for the right is **individual liberty**, especially in terms of personal responsibility and the belief that individuals should have the freedom to make their own choices without government interference. This reflects the classical liberal idea that the state should interfere as little as possible in people's lives.
   - For example, they advocate for **gun rights** under the Second Amendment, emphasizing the right to self-defense and personal freedom. They also oppose mandates like government-run healthcare, preferring private solutions that give people more choice.

3. **Limited Government and Constitutional Conservatism**:
   - The US right emphasizes **limited government** and adherence to the **Constitution**. They argue that the government’s role should be restricted to protecting individual rights, maintaining law and order, and providing national defense.
   - This often leads to opposition to large federal programs or social safety nets, with a preference for **state-level** decision-making and free-market solutions.

4. **Cultural Conservatism and Traditional Values**:
   - In contrast to the progressive social agenda of the left, the right often supports **traditional values** and **cultural conservatism**. They view these values as important for maintaining social order and cohesion.
   - For instance, many on the right oppose **abortion** and support **religious freedom** laws that allow individuals or businesses to act according to their religious beliefs, often in opposition to liberal social policies.

5. **Neoliberalism and Global Markets**:
   - Many on the US right embrace **neoliberalism**, which advocates for **global free markets** and trade, deregulation, and privatization of industries. The right generally supports reducing barriers to trade, as they believe economic globalization increases efficiency and prosperity.

### **Tensions Between the Two**:

Both the US left and right draw from liberalism, but their interpretations diverge based on how much they value **government intervention** and what kinds of **freedoms** they prioritize:

- **Left on Government Role**: The left sees **government intervention** as necessary to ensure equality and fairness, using laws and policies to promote social justice and regulate markets to protect vulnerable populations.

- **Right on Government Role**: The right believes in **limiting government** intervention, especially in the economy, and preserving individual freedom from state interference, trusting that the free market and traditional values will lead to a prosperous and stable society.

- **Social Issues**: The left focuses on **expanding civil rights** and personal freedoms in the context of race, gender, and sexuality. The right often frames freedoms in terms of **individual responsibility** and **traditional values** (e.g., family, religion).

### **Wordsmith and Political Ideologies**

A **wordsmith** plays a crucial role in both left and right politics, as language is key to shaping public opinion and policy. Skilled wordsmiths are capable of framing political ideas in ways that resonate with their target audience, using rhetoric to either advocate for change or defend tradition.

#### **Wordsmithing in Left Politics**:
- On the left, wordsmiths focus on **inclusivity** and **social justice**. They might use terms like "equity" or "climate justice" to frame policy goals in a way that speaks to progressive values.
- For example, framing healthcare reform as "Medicare for All" emphasizes universality and fairness, appealing to the left’s desire for social welfare.

#### **Wordsmithing in Right Politics**:
- On the right, wordsmiths focus on **freedom**, **self-reliance**, and **traditional values**. Terms like "personal responsibility" and "family values" are often used to frame policies around individual liberty and cultural conservatism.
- For instance, describing tax cuts as "economic freedom" or referring to regulation as "government overreach" appeals to the right’s belief in limited government and free markets.

### Conclusion

Liberalism provides the foundation for many of the values seen in US left and right politics, but the two sides have diverged in how they interpret and apply these principles. The **left** emphasizes equality, social justice, and government intervention to ensure fairness, while the **right** prioritizes individual freedoms, free markets, and limited government. **Wordsmiths** on both sides play a vital role in shaping and communicating these ideologies, using language to craft compelling narratives that resonate with their political base.
