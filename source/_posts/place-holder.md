  <div class="qa-item">
    <span class="label label-success">A</span>
    <span class="qa-text">This project tries to experiment with creating a tool called <code>POLITICS</code>, which is designed to assist individuals interested in voting activities by providing quantitative measures and data-driven procedures to understand the political leaning of candidates for general elections. <p></p> The primary purpose of the <code>POLITICS</code> tool is to offer voters a clear and objective understanding of a candidate's political stance by utilizing quantitative data and advanced analytical methods. This assists voters in making informed decisions during federal and general elections.</span>

    <span class="qa-text">Why is deciphering political discourse often challenging?</span>
  </div>
  <div class="qa-item">
    <span class="label label-success">A</span>
    <span class="qa-text">Political discourse can be exceedingly complex and difficult to interpret due to its nuanced and layered nature. Human interpretation is frequently influenced by personal biases and subjectivity, as highlighted by Chilton (2004) and van Dijk (2000), making it challenging to attain an unbiased understanding of political statements and positions.</span>

    <span class="qa-text">What are the different forms of political polarization?</span>
  </div>
  <div class="qa-item">
    <span class="label label-success">A</span>
    <span class="qa-text">
      Political polarization manifests in several forms:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Ideological Polarization:</b> This involves the divergence of political attitudes toward extreme ideological ends.</li>
        <li><b>Partisan Polarization:</b> This refers to the growing divide and loyalty strictly along party lines.</li>
        <li><b>Affective Polarization:</b> This pertains to the increasing negative feelings and hostility between members of different political groups.</li>
      </ul>
      These various forms of polarization significantly influence public discourse, policy-making, and voter behavior.

    <span class="qa-text">Can you elaborate on Ideological, Partisan, and Affective Polarization?</span>
  </div>
  <div class="qa-item">
    <span class="label label-success">A</span>
    <span class="qa-text">
      <ul>
        <li><b>Ideological Polarization:</b> Represents the widening gap in political beliefs and values, leading individuals and groups to adopt more extreme positions (Pew Research Center, 2014).</li>
        <li><b>Partisan Polarization:</b> Denotes the intensifying allegiance to one's political party, often resulting in decreased willingness to compromise across party lines.</li>
        <li><b>Affective Polarization:</b> Involves deep-seated emotional divisions, where individuals harbor strong negative feelings toward members of opposing parties (Iyengar & Westwood, 2015).</li>
      </ul>

    <span class="label label-danger">Q</span>
    <span class="qa-text">Why is understanding these types of polarization important?</span>
  </div>
  <div class="qa-item">
    <span class="label label-success">A</span>
    <span class="qa-text">Understanding these types of polarization is crucial for accurately interpreting political behaviors and trends. It helps in developing strategies to bridge divides, promote constructive dialogue, and foster a more cohesive political environment (Fiorina & Abrams, 2008).</span>

    <span class="qa-text">How does the <code>POLITICS</code> tool address the complexities of political polarization?</span>
  </div>
  <div class="qa-item">
    <span class="label label-success">A</span>
    <span class="qa-text">The <code>POLITICS</code> tool addresses these complexities by dynamically measuring politicians' stances using advanced statistical modeling methods, particularly <code>Variational Autoencoders</code>. This approach quantifies political leanings objectively, enabling clearer insights into individual positions and the overall landscape of political polarization.</span>

<div class="qa-container">
  <div class="qa-item">
    <span class="label label-danger">Q</span>
    <span class="qa-text">What are the benefits of using <code>Variational Autoencoders</code> in this context?</span>
  </div>
  <div class="qa-item">
    <span class="label label-success">A</span>
    <span class="qa-text">Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are beneficial because they can uncover latent structures within complex datasets without the need for labeled data. In the context of political analysis, VAEs can identify underlying ideological dimensions and distinguish between different political affiliations and topics through unsupervised learning methods.</span>

    <span class="label label-danger">Q</span>
    <span class="qa-text">How does the method employed by the <code>POLITICS</code> tool function?</span>
  </div>
  <div class="qa-item">
    <span class="label label-success">A</span>
    <span class="qa-text">
      The method functions through two primary steps:
      <ol>
        <li><b>Projection onto a One-Dimensional Space:</b> It projects an author's political stance onto a one-dimensional ideological spectrum, identifying their position based on the topics they discuss.</li>
        <li><b>Unsupervised Separation:</b> Without relying on predefined labels or political information, the tool can separate authors according to their party affiliations and relevant politicized topics by analyzing patterns and structures within the data.</li>
      </ol>
