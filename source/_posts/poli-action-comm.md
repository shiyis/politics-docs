## ðŸ”» More on Super PACs, Campaign Finances, And Independent Expenditures

`The Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010)` decision had a significant impact on the formation of super PACs, leading to a proliferation of these entities and a dramatic increase in their influence on the political landscape.

Here's how:

### **Removal of spending limits**


- The Citizens United decision struck down a key provision of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA), also known as McCain-Feingold, which prohibited corporations and labor unions from spending money on electioneering communications (ads, etc.) that mentioned a candidate's name within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election.

- This ruling effectively removed limits on independent expenditures by corporations, labor unions, and other organizations.

### **Creation of super PACs**

- In response to the Citizens United decision, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) issued new rules in 2010, allowing for the creation of super PACs.

- These entities, also known as independent expenditure-only committees, can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to support or oppose candidates, as long as they do not coordinate with the candidates or their campaigns.


### **Unlimited fundraising**

- Super PACs can accept unlimited contributions from individuals, corporations, labor unions, and other organizations.

- This allows them to raise massive amounts of money, often from a small group of wealthy donors.


### **Increased influence**

- With unlimited fundraising capabilities, super PACs can spend enormous sums on advertising, voter mobilization, and other campaign activities, giving them significant influence over the political process.


### **Anonymity**

- While super PACs are required to disclose their donors to the FEC, some donors can remain anonymous by contributing to non-profit organizations, known as 501(c)(4) groups, which can then donate to super PACs. This lack of transparency has raised concerns about the potential for dark money to influence elections.

### **Proliferation of super PACs**

- Since the Citizens United decision, the number of super PACs has grown exponentially.

- According to the Center for Responsive Politics, there were over 2,000 super PACs registered with the FEC in the 2020 election cycle, compared to just 83 in the 2010 cycle.

- Shift in political power: The rise of super PACs has shifted power from traditional political parties and candidates to these outside groups, which can now wield significant influence over the political process.


In summary, the Citizens United decision paved the way for the creation of super PACs, which can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections. This has led to a significant increase in the influence of outside groups on the political process, raising concerns about the impact of money on politics and the potential for dark money to shape election outcomes.
